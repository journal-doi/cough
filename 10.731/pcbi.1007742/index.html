		<title>Chalamet Coughs, Dune Wins: Predicting Best Picture Winners Using Coughs and Sneezes.</title>
		<meta name="description" content="Abstract: Many movies have coughs and sneezes in them. Some win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Is there a connection? The mainstream statistical hegemony says “no,” but our research suggests otherwise. We have created a model capable of predicting a Best Picture winner based on the number of coughs and sneezes in nominated films. This allows us not only to predict this year’s winner with 91.7% accuracy, but also to determine that Viggo Mortensen will be cast as Batman at some point in the future.">
